TDD Calculator Kata

Implementation which is the result of going over the TDD Calculator Kata:

1. An empty string returns zero
2. A single number returns the value
3. Two numbers, comma delimited, returns the sum
4. Two numbers, newline delimited, returns the sum
5. Three numbers, delimited either way, returns the sum
6. Negative numbers throw an exception
7. Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
8. A single char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //# for a ‘#’ as the delimiter)
9. A multi char delimiter can be defined on the first line (e.g. //[###] for ‘###’ as the delimiter)
10. Many single or multi-char delimiters can be defined (each wrapped in square brackets) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
